#GesAuth
###GesAuth is a User Authorization Library for CodeIgniter 2.x, which aims to make easy some essential jobs such as login, permissions and access operations for web application.
by [GaÃ«tan Cottrez](http://laviedunwebdeveloper.com/)

##Description
GesAuth is based on Aauth (https://github.com/emreakay/CodeIgniter-Aauth). Thank a lot to the author =).
I created this library about an example that serves as starter kit for a web application.
It contains a CRUD for managing users and groups with permissions generated with Grocery CRUD (https://github.com/scoumbourdis/grocery-crud).
It also contains a web application design generated via a custom bookstore (template.php) created by me.
The folder package contains all files to library GesAuth

##My philosophy: an example is better than a long documentation

##Learning opportunities GesAuth an example

 - Just copy the folder GesAuth in your localhost.
 - Create a new database gesauth and import file gesauth.sql
 - (Optionnal) Change parameter gesauth.application\config\database.php by your parameters
 - (Optionnal) Change parameter $config['language'] by french or english in gesauth.application\config\config.php by your parameters

 load GesAuth Library to system
```php
$this->load->library("GesAuth");
```
##Accounts user
```php
 - username / password / group : gaetan.cottrez / admin / Admin
 - username / password / group : john.doe / admin / default
```

##Most important method
```php 
 - login user : $this->gesauth->login($login,$password, $remember) => see controller login.php
 - error login : $this->gesauth->get_errors()  => see controller login.php
 - check user is login : $this->gesauth->is_loggedin()  => see library Template.php
 - update activity user login : $this->gesauth->update_activity()  => see library Template.php
 - control perms user : $this->gesauth->control()  => see library Template.php
```

##Future Features
 - Mode authentification LDAP
 - Choice of mode of MySQL or LDAP authentication or both

Aauth is a User Authorization Library for CodeIgniter 2.x, which aims to make easy some essential jobs such as login, permissions and access operations. Despite ease of use, it has also very advanced features like private messages, groupping, access management, public access etc..

After Quick Start, Take a look [detailed Documentation from wiki](https://github.com/emreakay/CodeIgniter-Aauth/wiki/_pages)  

### Features 
***
* User Management and Operations (login, logout, register, vertification via e-mail, forgoten password, ban management, login ddos protection)
* Group Operations (Creaing, deleting groups, membership management)
* Admin and Public Group support (Public permissions)
Permission Management (creating,deleting permissons, allow, deny groups, public permissions, permission checking)
* Private Messages (pm between users)
* Error Mesages and Validations
* Langugage and config file support
* Flexible

### Quick Start 
***
Let's start :)  
Firstly we will load Aauth Library to system
```php
$this->load->library("Aauth");
```
  
thats OK.  

Now we will create 2 new users, Ali and John  

```php
$this->aauth->create_user('ali@ali.com','alispass','Ali Akay');
$this->aauth->create_user('john@john.com','johnspass','John Button');
```
   
thats it. now we have two users.

Lets Create two group governors and commons :)
```php
$this->aauth->create_group('governors');
$this->aauth->create_user('commons');
```  

ok now we have two groups.

Lets create a permissions 'incrase_tax' and 'change_government' 

```php
$this->aauth->create_perm('increase_tax');
$this->aauth->create_perm('change_government');
```  

Ok, now lets give accesses. logically 'governors' will have 'increase_tax' permission and 'commons' will have 'change_government' access.  
ok lets give proper access with _alow()_ function

```php
$this->aauth->allow('governors','increase_tax');
$this->aauth->allow('commons','change_government');
  
  
$this->aauth->allow('commons','increase_tax');
``` 

Ops wait a minute.  commons cannot 'increase_tax'. we need to fix it, we will use deny() to take back permission.

```php
$this->aauth->deny('commons','increase_tax');
``` 


Ok now lets check if commons can 'increase_tax'

```php
if($this->aauth->is_allowed('commons','increase_tax')){
    // i dont think so
} else {
   // do sth in the middle
}
``` 

i think 'increse_tax' must have never been created. delete it

```php
$this->aauth->delete_perm('increase_tax');
``` 
now better.  
  
So what about public people? (public means not logged users). can public people travel? Lets assume we have permissions namely 'travel' , of course.


> $this->aauth->allow('public','travel')

  
So Admin? what can he do? He can access everthing, You dont need to give permiision ( allow() ) him, he already has.  
  
  
ok lets lokk at private messages. John (his id=3) will send pm to Ali(id=4)

```php
$this->aauth->send_pm(3,4,'Hi bro. i need you',' can you gimme your credit card?')
``` 
  
sorry John you will be banned :(

```php
$this->aauth->ban_user(3);
``` 
 
Quick Start is done but thats not the end
