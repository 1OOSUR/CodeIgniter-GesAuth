##Description
GesAuth is a fork to Aauth (https://github.com/emreakay/CodeIgniter-Aauth). Thank a lot to the author =).
I created this library about an example that serves as starter kit for a web application.
It contains a CRUD for managing users and groups with permissions generated with Grocery CRUD (https://github.com/scoumbourdis/grocery-crud).
It also contains a web application design generated via a custom bookstore (template.php) created by me.
The folder package contains all files to library GesAuth
